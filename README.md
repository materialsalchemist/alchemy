## TODO

- [x] Fix mismatch Hydrogens
- [ ] Add Images functionality (Resources to recheck to do it https://medium.com/towards-data-science/recursive-chemical-reactions-how-to-algorithmicallyanalyze-chemical-structures-c6a0fab95fa0)
- [x] Generating Molecule with more bond type
- [x] Add type notation
- [ ] Optimise with numpy vectorize
- [ ] Separate code into multiple files
- [ ] Add Machine Learning
- [x] Parallelism Generator

## Considerations

- A new Molecule type for contain both smiles and mol
- Use smarts for reactions instead of tuple
- Or Tuple of list of products and list of reactants
